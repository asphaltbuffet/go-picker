## Description

go-picker picks one-to-many items from a list and returns them to you. It is a convenient wrapper for randomly picking elements. There are options to force the selected items to be unique and/or perform several selections based on your criteria.

## Usage

```sh
go-picker yellow red blue green --pick=2 --repeat=2 --unique=true
```

## Build

### Terminal

- `make all` - execute the build pipeline with all steps.
- `make dev` - faster execution of the build pipeline that skips some steps
- `make help` - print help for the [Make targets](Makefile).

### Visual Studio Code

`F1` ‚Üí `Tasks: Run Build Task (Ctrl+Shift+B or ‚áß‚åòB)` to choose a build pipeline.
